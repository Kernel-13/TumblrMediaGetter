# TumblrMediaGetter
Download different kinds of media files from most tumblr blogs

Capabilities:
---------------------
* Download all pictures posted/reblogged by some user
* Download most videos posted/reblogged by some user
* Download most audio posted/reblogged by some user

**It isn't capable of downloading embedded videos (from youtube, instagram, vine, etc)**

How to Use:
---------------------
* Choose one of the 3 options available
* Enter a **_tumblr user name_** (ie. kernel13, not kernel13.tumblr.com)
* It will start downloading files until it finishes downloading them all or reaches a "rate limit" (1,000 requests per hour)
* You can stop the application at any time by pressing Ctrl+Z

Future Plans:
---------------------
* Tag filtering, so it only gets content with a specific tag (or group of tags)
* Customizable format for the filenames (using 'post' values like id, timestamp, date, tags, etc)
